# Sodium Vanilla

## About

Sodium Vanilla is a client-side modpack that, like **Sodium Plus**, adds performance and quality-of-life improvements.
Unlike Sodium Plus, it is **automatically updated** to the latest Minecraft version.

## Versions

Each Minecraft version has two modpacks: `_safe` and `_full`.

* `_safe`: only includes mods safe for multiplayer servers.
* `_full`: may contain mods which might not be allowed on some servers - use with caution.

## No Default Configuration

This modpack does not include any preset configuration files.
That means you can safely update your Minecraft instance without overwriting your current settings.

## Tweakeroo Features

Tweakeroo is a powerful mod with many useful client-side tweaks that many players don't know about, including freecam, fullbright, hand restock, shulker/bundle/enderchest preview, hold left/right click, autoclicker, zoom, auto tool replacement, tool break warnings, and much more.
